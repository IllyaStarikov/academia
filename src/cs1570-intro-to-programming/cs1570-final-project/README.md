# cs1570-final-project
This is the solution to the final project for Introduction to Programming for the Spring semester. This should serve solely as a reference to said assignment. Note that the coding standards are not adhered and it lacks documentation. There were some changes to the constants and the way particular methods act, but the core logic is the same. Also, it was written over the course of a weekend, so some programming choices might be questionable.

The program description can found on the [course website](https://sites.google.com/a/mst.edu/price/courses/cs-1570/), specifically [here](https://sites.google.com/a/mst.edu/price/courses/cs-1570/hw/2017/spring/assignment-10---final-project). *This project is now considered deprecated*.
