As the fall semester comes to a start, there is renovating needing to be done. With a looney teacher — Clayton Price — now gone, someone had to take his place. Someone had to take the reigns. Someone had to control the evil, Computer Science Empire.

Someone more vile.
Someone more powerful..
Someone much, much worse...

With the series of unfortonate events that occured, you have to retake CS1570. Better than the mass killing spree, though, right? You are in the new class, with new students all around you, excited to see the new teacher. He walks in, with a cup of coffee in his hand and look in his eyes that make the new students nervous.

They knew that this new teacher was going to be just as difficult as the last.

The new teacher examines the classroom, takes a sip of his coffee, and says: "Hello, class. Welcome to CS1570. I will be your new instructor, my name is.. Illya Starikov."
