# 1. The Shuffle Deck 5000
1. Get a deck.
2. Take said deck, and cut it into two stacks â€” 26 cards each.
3. Place each in alternating hand, face down.
4. Place the stacks relatively close together, enough to merge them with no
friction, but not to the point it's impossible to shuffle.
5. Place thumb on topmost part, while holding relatively lower part parts of
the deck. 
6. Release one card from your right hand, by shift cards back a little.
7. Do so with your left hand.
8. Repeat steps 6-7 26 times.
9. Repeat steps 2-8 3 times.

# 2. Matrix Extravaganza 
1. Looking for two letter words, start searching vertically from bottom to
# top. 
2. Upon reaching the end of the matrix, shift to the next row/column.
3. When you reach the end of the block, start with a different orientation.
Start with top to down, left to right, right to left, and then diagonals.
4. If successful, skip to step 6.
5. Repeat steps 1-5, this time search by adding one more letter to your
memory. The first time reaching this step, look for three. Then four. And
repeat.
6. You are finished.

# 3. Basic Subtraction
1. Write the first set of digits (let's refer to them by abcd), followed by
# an aligned set of digits (zyxv). Then draw a line underneath. They should
# align vertically, like so:
abcd
zyxv
2. Take the bottom right most value and subtract it from the top most value.
You should be doing subtracting the "v" value from "d" value at this point.
3. Do so, shifting from right to left at the top tier and the bottom tier,
simultaneously. Example: instead of subtracting "d" from "v", subtract "x"
from "c"
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until reaching the end.
5. If what is being subtracted is larger than what is subtracting, then
write a negative.
6. Congratulations, you have successfully subtracted 4 digits. Go hang it on
the fridge!
