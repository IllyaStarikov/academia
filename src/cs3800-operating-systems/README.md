# Introduction To Operating Systems
The following repository is all of *my* homework solutions and crib sheets for Introduction to Operating systems, as taught by Dr. Ercal at Missouri S&T. Because the instructor is retiring, the following homework will likely never be assigned again.

## Homeworks
### Homework #1
Homework #1 was a simple Bash script to

- Print the ancestry tree of the currently running process (i.e. the shell script) like a tree.
- Print the users tgat are online.
- Print out what processes any user is running.
- Let the user choose between the mentioned options via a Menu.

### Homework #2
Homework #2 was to simulate a memory management system with three algorithms:

1. Clock Page Replacement
2. Least Recently Used Page Replacement
3. First In First Out Page Replacement

Also, there is a report detailing how the algorithm performed, with a graph.

### Homework 3
Homework #3 was to create a server and client. Both of which are written in Python3. The client is an iOS application, and relies on [SwiftSocket](https://github.com/swiftsocket/SwiftSocket), [JSQMessagesViewController](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController), and [SkyFloatingLabelTextField](https://github.com/Skyscanner/SkyFloatingLabelTextField). There is a Podfile, just run `pod install` in the top-level directory.

## Crib Sheets
The cribsheets are written in LaTeX, in a really small font. We were given a question pool and a glossary before hand, so all of the definitions are basically pasted in. To run, simply run `pdflatex CRIBSHEET`.
