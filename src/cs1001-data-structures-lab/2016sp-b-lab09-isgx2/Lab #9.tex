\section{Drip, Drip, Drip, Drip}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Memory leak, \texttt{indirectly lost: 80 bytes in 5 blocks} and \texttt{definitely lost: 16 bytes in 1 blocks}
    \item Because a \texttt{pointer} to a list is being created, but not freed.
    \item Done!
\end{enumerate}

\section{Imagine the possibilities!}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{possibly lost, still reachable, suppressed}.
    \item I was.. I knew it.
    \item There is a destructor in \texttt{dtor} and \texttt{plain} only has the default (which does not take care of manual memory allocation).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Use wisely}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Memory Leak.
    \item You have a memory address assigned to an memory address.
    \item Done.
\end{enumerate}
