Is there a path from root \textit{a} to node \textit{b}? Let's algorithmize!

\begin{vervatim}
// Recursive
pathSearch(Graph G, start, goal, visited nodes) {
    if start == goal { return true; }

    add started to visited nodes
    for every neighbor x of start not in visited nodes
        solved = pathSearch(G, x, goal, visited nodes)
        if solved {
            return true
        }

    return false;
}

// Not Recursive
pathSearch(Graph G, srat, goal, Visited) {
    stack of nodes S
    push(S, start)

    while (S is not empty) {
        X = top(S)
        pop(S);

        if (x == goal)
            return true

        add x to visited

        for every neighbor y of x, not in viisted
            push (S, y)
    }

    return false;
}
