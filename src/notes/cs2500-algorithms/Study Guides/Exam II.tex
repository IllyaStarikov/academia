\begin{itemize}
    \item Dynamic Programming Two Properties
    \begin{description}
        \item [Overlapping Subproblems] A recursive solution contains a small number of distinct subproblems repeated many times
        \item [Expressed Recursively] An optimal solution to a problem contains optimal solution to subproblems
    \end{description}
    \item Subsequence: A sequence aIer deleting some elements
    \item A algorithm always makes the choice that looks best at the moment
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Used for optimization
        \item Make local optimal choices and hope to achieve global optimality (Greedy-choice property)
        \item An optimal solution to the problem contains an optimal solution to subproblems (opCmal substructure)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Graph
    \begin{itemize}
        \item a symbolic representaBon of a network and of its connectivity
    \end{itemize}
    \item There are two ways to represent graphs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Adjacency list
        \item Adjacency matrix
    \end{itemize}
    \item Cut edge: Edge whose deletion will increase the number of connected components (Disconnect the graph)
\end{itemize}

\section{Complexities}
\subsection{Space Requirements}
\begin{description}
    \item [Adjacency Lists] For directed and directed $\Theta(V + E)$
    \item [Adjacency Matrix] For directed and undirected $\Theta(V^2)$
\end{description}

\subsection{Search Complexities}
\begin{description}
    \item [Breadth-First] $\mathcal{O}(V+E)$
    \item [Depth-First] $\mathcal{O}(V+E)$
\end{description}

\section{Coloring Depth First Search}
\begin{description}
    \item [White] undiscovered
    \item [Gray] discovered but not finished
    \item [Black] finished (found every reachable vertex from it)
\end{description}
