\subsection{Stokes' Theorem}
Let $S$ be a smooth oriented surface in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with a smooth closed boundary $C$ whose orientation is consistent with that of $S$. Assume that $\mathbf{F} = \langle f,\, g,\, h \rangle$ is a vector field whose components have continuous first partial derivatives on $S$. Then

\begin{equation}
    \oint \limits _C \textbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{r} = \iint \limits _S \left( \nabla \times \textbf{F} \right) \cdot \mathbf{n}\, dS
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\mathbf{n}$ is the unit vector normal to $S$ determined by the orientation of $S$.

\subsubsection{Curl $\mathbf{F = 0}$ Implies $\mathbf{F}$ is Conservative}
Suppose that $\mathbf{\nabla \times F = 0}$ throughout an open simply connected region $D$ of $\mathbb{R}^3$. Then $\oint \limits _C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = 0$ on all closed simple smooth curves $C$ in $D$ and $\mathbf{F}$ is a conservative vector field on $D$.
