\subsection{Green's Theorem}
Let $C$ be a simple closed smooth curve, oriented counterclockwise, that encloses a connected and simply connected region $R$ in the plane. Assume $\mathbf{F} = \langle f,\, g \rangle$, where $f$ and $g$ have continuous first partial derivatives in $R$. Then

\begin{equation}
    \oint \limits _C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = \oint f \, dx + g \, dy = \iint \limits _R \left( \frac{\partial g}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right) dA.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Two-Dimensional Curl}
The \textbf{two-dimensional curl} of the vector field $\mathbf{F} = \langle f,\, g \rangle$ is $\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$. If the curl is zero throughout a region, the vector field is said to be \textbf{irrotational} on that region.

\subsubsection{Area of a Plane Region by Line Integrals}
Under the conditions of Green's Theorem, the area of a region $R$ enclosed by a curve $C$ is

\begin{equation}
    \oint \limits _C x \, dy = - \oint \limits _C y \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \oint \limits _C (x \, dy - y \, dx)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Green's Thoerem, Flux Form}
Let $C$ be a simple closed smooth curve, oriented counterclockwise, that encloses a connected and simply connected region $R$ in the plane. Assume $\mathbf{F} = \langle f,\, g \rangle$, where $f$ and $g$ have continuous first partial derivatives in $R$. Then

\begin{equation}
    \oint \limits _C \mathbf{F \cdot n} \, ds = \oint \limits _C f \, dy - g \, dx = \iint \limits _R \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial g}{\partial y} \right)
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{n}$ is the outward unit normal vector on the curve.

\subsubsection{Two-Dimensional Divergence}
The \textbf{two-dimensional divergence} of the vector field $\mathbf{F} = \langle f,\, g \rangle$ is $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}$. If the divergence is zero thoughout a region, the vector field is said to be \textbf{source free} on that region.
