\subsection{Continuity}
\subsubsection{Continuity at a Point}
A function $f$ is \textbf{continuous} at $a$ if $\limit{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = f(a)$. If $f$ is not continuous at $a$, then $a$ is a point of discontinuity.

\subsubsection{Continuity Checklist}
In order for $f$ to be continuous at $a$, the following three conditions must hold:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $f(a)$ is defined ($a$ is in the domain of $f$).
    \item $\limit{x \rightarrow a} f(x)$ exists.
    \item $limit{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = f(a)$ (the value of $f$ equals the limit of $f$ at $a$).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Continuity Rules}
If $f$ and $g$ are continuous at $a$, then the following functions are also continuous at $a$. Assume $c$ is a constant and $n > 0$ is an integer.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $f + g$
    \item $f - g$
    \item $cf$
    \item $fg$
    \item $f / g$, provided $g(a) \neq 0$
    \item ${(f(x))}^n$
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Polynomial and Rational Functions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A polynomial function is continuous for all $x$.
    \item A rational function (a function of the form $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are polynomials) is continuous for all $x$ for which $q(x) \neq 0$
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Continuity of Composite Function at a Point}
If $g$ is continuous at $a$ and $f$ is continuous at $g(a)$, then the composite function $f \cdot g$ is continuous at $a$.

\subsubsection{Continuity at Endpoints}
A function $f$ is \textbf{is continuous from the left} (or \textbf{left-continuous}) at $a$ if $\limit{x \rightarrow a^-} f(x) = f(a)$ and $f$ is \textbf{continuous from the right} (or \textbf{right-continuous}) at $a$ if $\limit{x \rightarrow a^+} f(x) = f(a)$. 

\subsubsection{Continuity on an Interval}
A function $f$ is continuous on an interval $I$ if it is continuous at all points of $I$. If $i$ contains its endpoints, continuous on $I$ means continuous from the right or left at the endpoints.

\subsubsection{Continuity of Functions with Roots}
Assume that $m$ and $n$ are positive integers with no common factors. If $m$ is an odd integer, then ${[ f(x) ]}^{n/m}$ is continuous at all points at which $f$ is continuous. If $m$ is even, then ${[ f(x) ]}^{n/m}$ is continuous at all points at which $f$ is continuous and $f(a) > 0$.

\subsubsection{Continuity of Inverse Functions}
If $a$ continuous function $f$ has an inverse on an interval $I$, then its inverse $f^{-1}$ is also continuous (on the interval consisting of the points $f(x)$), where $x$ is in $I$. 

\subsubsection{Continuity of Transcendental Functions}
The following functions are continuous at all points of their domain.

\noindent\textbf{Trigonometric}
\begin{align}
    \sin x &\qquad \cos x \\
    \tan x &\qquad \cot x \\
    \sec x &\qquad \csc x 
\end{align}

\noindent\textbf{Inverse Trigonometric}
\begin{align}
    \sin^{-1} x &\qquad \cos^{-1} x \\
    \tan^{-1} x &\qquad \cot^{-1} x \\
    \sec^{-1} x &\qquad \csc^{-1} x
\end{align}

\noindent\textbf{Exponential}
\begin{equation}
    b^x \qquad e^x
\end{equation}

\noindent\textbf{Logarithmic}
\begin{equation}
    \log_b x \qquad \ln x
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{The Intermediate Value Theorem}
Suppose $f$ is continuous on the interval $[a, b]$ and $L$ is a number $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. Then there is at least one number $c$ in $(a, b)$ satisfying $f(x) = L$.
