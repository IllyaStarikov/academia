\subsection{Linear Approximation and Differentials}
\subsubsection{Linear Approximation to $f$ at $a$}
Suppose $f$ is differentiable on an interval $I$ containing the point $a$. The \textbf{linear approximation} to $f$ at $a$ is the linear function 

\begin{equation}
    L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a)\text{, for $x$ in $I$}.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Relationship Between $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$}
Suppose $f$ is differentiable on an interval $I$ containing the point $a$. The change in the value of $f$ between two points $a$ and $a + \Delta x$ is approximately 

\begin{equation}
    \Delta y \approx f'(a) \Delta x,
\end{equation}

where $a + \Delta x$ is in $I$.

\subsubsection{Uses of Linear Approximation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To approximate $f$ near $x = a$, use

        \begin{equation}
            f(x) \approx L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a)
        \end{equation}

    \item To approximate the change $\Delta y$ in the dependent variable when $x$ changes from $a + \Delta x$, use

        \begin{equation}
            \Delta y \approx f'(a) \Delta x
        \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Differentials}
Let $f$ be differentiable on an interval containing $x$. A small change in $x$ is denoted by the \textbf{differential} $dx$. The corresponding change in $f$ is approximated by the \textbf{differential} $dy = f'(x) dx$; that is,

\begin{equation}
    \Delta y = f(x + dx) - f(x) \approx dy = f'(x) dx
\end{equation}
