\subsection{Mean Value Theorem}
\subsubsection{Rolle's Theorem}
Let $f$ be continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$ with $f(a) = f(b)$. There is at least one point $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.

\subsubsection{Mean Value Theorem}
If $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$, then there is at least one point $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that

\begin{equation}
    \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} = f'(c)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Zero Derivative Implies Constant Function}
If $f$ is differentiable and $f'(x) = 0$ at all points of an interval $I$, then $f$ is a constant function on $I$.

\subsubsection{Function with Equal Derivatives Differ by a Constant}
If two functions have the property that $f'(x) = g'(x)$, for all $x$ of an interval $I$, then $f(x) - g(x) = C$ on $I$, where $C$ is a constant; that is $f$ and $g$ differ by a constant.

\subsubsection{Intervals of Increase and Decrease}
Suppose $f$ is continuous on an interval $I$ and differentiable at all interior points of $I$. If $f'(x) > 0$ at all interior points of $I$, then $f$ is increasing on $I$. If $f'(x) < 0$ at all interior points of $I$, then $f$ is decreasing on $I$.
