\subsection{Graphing Functions}
\subsubsection{Graphing Guidelines for $y = f(x)$}
\begin{enumdescript}
    \item[Identify the domain or interval of interest.] On what interval should the function be graphed? It may be the domain of the function or some subset of the domain.

    \item[Exploit symmetry.] Take advantage of symmetry. For example, is the function \textit{even} ($f(-x) = f(x)$), \textit{odd} ($f(-x) = -f(x)$) or neither?

    \item[Find the first and second derivatives.] They are needed to determine extreme values, concavity, inflection points, and intervals of increase and decrease. Computing derivativesâ€”particularly second derivatives may not be practical, so some functions may need to be graphed without complete derivative information.

    \item[Find critical points and possible inflection points.] Determine points at which $f'(x) = 0$ or $f'$ is undefined. Determine points at which $f''(x) = 0$ or $f''$   is undefined.

    \item[Find intervals on which the function is increasing/decreasing and concave up/down.] The first derivative determines the intervals of increase and decrease. The second derivative determines the intervals on which the function is concave up or concave down.

    \item[Identify extreme values and inflection points.] Use either the First or the Second Derivative Test to classify the critical points. Both x- and y-coordinates of maxima, minima, and inflection points are needed for graphing.

    \item[Locate vertical/horizontal asymptotes and determine end behavior.] Vertical asymptotes often occur at zeros of denominators. Horizontal asymptotes require examining limits as $x \rightarrow \pm \infty$; these limits determine end behavior.

    \item[Find the intercepts.] The y-intercept of the graph is found by setting $x = 0$. The x-intercepts are the real zeros (or roots) of a function: those values of $x$ that satisfy $f(x) = 0$.
