\subsection{Optimization Problems}
\section{Guidelines for Optimization Problems}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Read the problem carefully, identify the variables, and organize the given information with a picture.
    \item Identify the objective function (the function to be optimized). Write it in terms of the variables of the problem.
    \item Identify the constraints. Write them in terms of the variables of the problem.
    \item Use the constraints to eliminate all but one independent variable of the objective function.
    \item With the objective function expressed in terms of a single variable, find the interval of interest for that variable.
    \item Use methods of calculus to find the absolute maximum or minimum value of the objective function on the interval of interest. If necessary, check the endpoints.
\end{enumerate}
