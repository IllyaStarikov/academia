    \footnotesize The program works as expected. All classes are properly implemented. Milhouse is chased by phantom pants. Bullies are scattered. Milhouse doesn't run over stuff. A clean, 17x17 grid is displayed. \textbf{Colors are required}. & \centering 40 & & & \\ \hline
    \footnotesize
    The program is semantically correct. No segmentation faults, infinite loops, program properly terminates, etc. & \centering 20 & & & \\ \hline
    \footnotesize Proper use of object oriented programming. Use of abstraction and encapsulation. Implementation details are marked private, vital functionality is marked public. & \centering 10 & & & \\ \hline
    \footnotesize Proper documentation. Preconditions, post-conditions, and description are articulated. & \centering 10 & & & \\ \hline
    \footnotesize Style guide is adhered to. Braces are on new lines, no tabs are used, constants are uppercased, etc. & \centering 10 & & & \\ \hline
    \footnotesize Presentation. Prepared for presentation, able to properly answer questions, brought snacks. & \centering 10 & & & \\ \hline

\section{Additional Questions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What extra things did you implement?
    \item What was the work split? (For this, \textbf{you do not have to be honest}. If one person did all the work, and you want equal credit, say equal work. However, keep in mind I will grade more leniently those who did more work.)
    \item How did you handle Milhouse getting randomly placed on the map?
    \item How did you handle the phantom pants chasing Milhouse?
    \item How are your classes structured? As in, how did you choose what was public or private?
    \item Did issues did you run into during coding this assignment?
\end{itemize}
