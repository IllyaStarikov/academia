\subsection{Book Notes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item For a conductor to have a steady current, it must be part of a path that forms a closed loop (or a complete circuit).
    \item A battery is not a current source --- You might have thought that a battery or other source of emf always produces the same current, no what circuit it's used in. $\mathcal{E} - Ir = IR \implies I = \frac{\mathcal{E}}{R + r}$ says it isn't so. The greater the resistance $R$ of the external circuit the less the current the source will produce.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Recitation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rate of energy conversion: $P = I \mathcal{E} $
    \item Energy lost $P = I^2 r_1$
    \item Total power supplied $P = I \mathcal{E}_1 - I^2 r_1$
\end{itemize}
