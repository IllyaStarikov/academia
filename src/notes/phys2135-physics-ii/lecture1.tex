\subsection{Book Notes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item When charges are at rest in our frame of reference, they exert electrostatic forces on each other.
    \item Electrostatic forces are governed by a simple relationship known as Coulomb’s law and are most conveniently described by using the concept of electric field.
    \item Two positive charges or two negative charges repel each other. A positive charge and a negative charge attract each other.
    \item The algebraic sum of all the electric charges in any closed system is constant.
    \item The magnitude of charge of the electron or proton is a natural unit of charge.
    \item The electric force on a charged body is exerted by the electric field created by other charged bodies.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lecture Notes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Law of conservation of charge: the net amount of electric charge produced in any process is zero.
\end{itemize}
