# Talking Points
- This experiment will be rough. I want to sprint ahead and start working while you guys do the proposed solutions.
- C++ okay?
- Floyd Warshall is my choice (but don't say it until everyone has discussed) 

# Report I
The part of the reports are as follows:

- **Abstract**: Illya.
- **Introduction and motivation**: Illya
- **Proposed solutions**: Tim and Claire.
    + Directed degree distribution (*Illya*) 
    + Unweighted/weighted shortest path distribution (*Illya*)
- **Plan of experiments**: Illya.
- **Roles**: Illya. *Ask if appropriate.*

# Report II
This is for report II:

- Abstract: Summary of the following sections and results
- Implementation: All
    + Directed degree distribution (*Illya*) 
    + Unweighted/weighted shortest path distribution (*Illya*)
    + Graph Diameter
    + Closeness centrality
    + Betweenness centrality distribution
    + Community Detection.
- Experiments: Description of the experiments performed and obtained results. Results
should be represented in a graphical form as well as discussed in the writing.
- *Role*
- **Conclusions**: Summary of the work and final considerations.
