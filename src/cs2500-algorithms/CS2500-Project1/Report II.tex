\section{Abstract}
As proposed in the first report, we would like to the compare the effeciency of different memory management methods via a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem#0.2F1_knapsack_problem}{0-1 Knapsack}. We discussed the current memory management methods, the different approaches we would like to use (Brute Force, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Solution) and our plan of implementations.

After implementing the pseudocode provided in Report \#1, rigerous testing and extensive running of sample of data, we have completed conclusive evidence to our proposed problem.

In this report we would like to discuss our findings.
