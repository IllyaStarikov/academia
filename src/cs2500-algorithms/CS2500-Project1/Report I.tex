\section{Abstract}
Smartphone users launch many apps everyday, however one of the most fundamental things a smartphone does is abstracted away: memory management.

Although smartphones have advance significantly (RAM, architecture, processors) compared to their first predecessor's, deactivation \footnote{The process of ``the operating system needing to choose and remove some apps from the memory'', a subproblem of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management}{memory management}.} is a solution that is often less-than-perfect. Although Java's \href{http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/java/gc01/index.html}{Garbage Collection} and Swift's \href{https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html}{Automatic Reference Counting} (ARC) have sufficed, there are other methods.

In this project I propose to solve this problem three techniques:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Brute Force
    \item Dynamic Programming
    \item Greedy Solution
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction and Motivation}
As stated previously, memory management is solved in a less-than-perfect manner. Although current technology suffices, we would like to compare algorithms to show the significant gains via three different approaches (Brute Force, Dynamics Programming, and Greedy).

\section{Proposed Solution}
For our project we decided to take a more \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph}{skeuomorphic} and object oriented approach, modeling objects after their real world counterparts, such as \texttt{Application} or \texttt{Smartphone}. As for the approaches, we have the following solutions:

\subsection{Brute Force}
\subsection{Dynamic Programming}
\subsection{Greedy Solution}
