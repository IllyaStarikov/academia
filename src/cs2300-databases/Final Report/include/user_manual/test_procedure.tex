This database was well tested before it reached you, the user. This section will explain how the test database was created and what tests the database went through before completion. The mock data was created using C++ code to randomly generate data. Data from online was used to create First Names, Last Names, Usernames, and Group Names as well as to populate the workout subclasses in strength and cardio. Using C++ code to randomly select and combine information, creating unique data. This mock data was then put through a series of tests to make sure the functions would work properly. Each function was tested over 500 times to error or improper analysis of the data. After confirming that these functions were working properly, they were implemented into the database.
