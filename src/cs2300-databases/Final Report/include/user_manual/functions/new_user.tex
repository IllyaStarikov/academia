\section{New User}
New User creates new users in the database. The user must input a username, email, height, birthdate, goal, and password. If any of those are not provided, an error message will be generated.

\subsection*{Parameters}
\begin{description}
    \item [id, username, email, heightFeet, heightInches, birthdate, goal, password] All the attributes that can be inserted into user table.
    \item [joinDate, gender, firstName, mInitial, lastName] See above.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Results}
Provided all the attributes meet database constraints, a new user will be inserted into the database. If a constraint is not meant, there will be a message outputting the error and the insert will be rejected.
