Let face it, every social network occasionally needs some help. That is why we have a shell script that executes our C++ codebase to auto-populate the table. The shell script runs like so:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Change to the directory of the C++ codebase.
    \item Run the makefile
    \item Run the executable, pipe that to an output file.
    \item Move the shell script to the directory of all the other \texttt{sql} files.
\end{enumerate}

This makes for easily produced, new data.
