\maketitle

For the second project, we were delighted to be able to use a higher level programming language; we\footnote{Illya.} decided to apply this new-found excitement to implement a retro game from the \num{70}s: Space Invaders.

\section{Project Description}

\section{Problems Encountered}
Below we will list some of the ``several'' problems we ran into.

\subsection{Memory Constraints}
By far, the biggest problem we encountered was the memory constraint. The \SI{8051} has \SI{8}{\kilo\byte} of memory; our code base, with the exclusion of all the \shellcmd{malloc}s\footnote{Since \shellcmd{unsigned char} = \SI{1}{\byte}, the terminal window will roughly be $20\text{ height} \times 80\text{ width} $, we can roughly expect \SI{1.6}{\kilo\byte} to be allocated on the heap; a non-insignificant amount compared to \SI{8}{\kilo\byte}.}, it is roughly \SI{25}{\kilo\byte} --- a size a bit larger than the \num{8051} allows. Our workaround was to fight fire with fire.

Instead of ``dumbing'' our game down to get it to fit, we decided to have an external interface; specifically, a port sniffer. It would listen for input from the \num{8051}, and if there is a signal on the serial port, use that as input. If not, default to the keyboard input.

Ultimately, we were \todo{add what happened with port sniffer.}
