# Differential Equations Plotter
Differential Equations at [Missouri S&T](http://www.mst.edu) require homework turned in on paper. Often, what will be required is a plot of graph such as `Î´_2pi(t) cosh t^2` or something of that nature. This are incredibly hard to do by hand, and screenshots of [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) got tedious. So, I wrote something to do it for me.

The equations are plotted courtesy of [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org). They're nothing fancy, just standard graphs with labels. After plotting them, they are exported to a LaTeX file, where they are subsequently compiled and opened by the defaults pdf reader.

Note that the plots are opened, and the script will not terminated until they are closed. This is to ensure a double check that all graphs are correct. Also the images are in eps, for best quality.
