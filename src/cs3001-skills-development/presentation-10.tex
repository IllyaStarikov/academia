        \frametitle{A Brief Introduction}

        I have always had a problem with being financially responsible. As I am about to graduate, and will have exponentially more bills, I want a way to be able to handle all of them reasonably. So, I decided I needed a budget.
    \end{frame}

    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{A Brief Introduction}

        I knew I would need a tool to help budget; after some search, I settled on EmPower. I also knew I needed something to invest money into, so I settled on Acorns.

    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{Prior Knowledge}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item I've had mediocre money management skills in the past.
            \item I would basically ballpark expenses and such.
            \item Although this would suffice in college, it would not last me in the real world long.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}

    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{Goals}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item To keep a reliable budget for the entirety of the semester.
            \item To be able to update my budget when I graduate easily.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}

    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{Resources}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item All of the learning (besides a couple of articles online) came from experimenting.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}

    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{Goal Accomplishment}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item I successfully created a budget within EmPower.

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item It handles all my weekly expenses (i.e., grocery shopping), monthly expenses (i.e., utilities or internet), and other miscellaneous expenses (entertainment).
                \end{itemize}

            \item I also was able to save a considerate amount into Acorns.

            \item The EmPower/Acorns system will be very useful when I graduate and move onto full time.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}

    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{Goal Not Accomplishment (Yet)}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Sticking to my budget was very hard. Some months I would hit the price point, other times I would miss it by orders of magnitude.
            \item I would sometimes pull money out of my savings account a little prematurely.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}


    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{Lessons Learned}

        The lesson I learned that was most valuable to me was to check my budget everyday. If I don't check it daily, I won't know how much I can or cannot spend. This could be for better or worse.
