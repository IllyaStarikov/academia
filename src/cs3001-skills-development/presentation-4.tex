        \frametitle{A Brief Introduction}

        They often say

        \begin{quote}
            ``A Developer Is Only As Good As His Tools''
        \end{quote}

        Although I don't agree with this sentiment, I always wanted to become better with tools I was constantly using. One of the tools I use most is my code editor: \href{https://www.vim.org}{Vim}.

    \end{frame}

    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{A Brief Introduction}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Vim has been around since 1991, and is almost ubiquitous on all Unix machines. It has served mostly as a terminal text editor (see attached video).
            \item Also, Vim has greatly improved a lot since then, to incorporate many of the new features that IDEs and Text Editors have brought to the table.
            \item Along with that, a lot of projects have set out to make Vim look and feel more like a regular text editor (as apposed to a terminal editor).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}

    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{Prior Knowledge}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item I've been using Vim since my freshmen year. However, I never worked with the advanced features of Vim, only the top level features.
            \item I knew that Vim had an expansive feature set, and I wanted to dive into that.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}


    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{Motivation}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Upon graduation, I will likely be using Vim full time at my time at Garmin.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}


    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{Goals}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item To become more efficient at using Vim.
            \item To become familiar with the modern parts of Vim.
            \item To learn more of the keystrokes and shortcuts for Vim.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}

    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{Resources}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item A lot of the learning came from playing around with Vim. Anytime I found myself doing something repetitive, I simply tried to find a way to automate. Most of the time, there was a way.

            \item Book Resources (That I Actually Bought!):
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \href{https://pragprog.com/book/modvim/modern-vim}{Modern Vim}
                    \item \href{https://pragprog.com/book/dnvim2/practical-vim-second-edition}{Practical Vim}
                \end{itemize}

            \item Online Resources:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \href{https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/}{The Vim Subreddit}, for everyday improvements or general knowledge on Vim.
                    \item \href{http://vimcasts.org}{VimCasts}, for when I want to get a deeper look into a subject.
                    \item \href{https://vim-adventures.com}{Vim Adventures}, a little game to help understand Vim through a text adventure.
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}

    \begin{frame}
        \frametitle{Goal Accomplishment}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item I am much more fluent in using Vim, using shortcuts that significantly improve my workflow.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item See attached videos for details.
                \end{itemize}

            \item I have also learned to use plugins, to do completions.
            \item I have also learned to use many of the different parts of Vim I was unfamiliar with, such as:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Buffers
                    \item Registers
                    \item Advanced Search
                    \item Tags
                \end{itemize}

                And a lot more!
        \end{itemize}
